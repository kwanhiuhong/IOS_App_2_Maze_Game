# A small IOS app in swift, which allows you to play in a maze

## Note that you should not run this app in the simulator, but rather, you should connect to your iPhone to run this app, as the app will fetch the data from the gyroscope and accelerometer (which you couldn't find in the simulator).  

### The initial icon looks like:

### The first page when you open the app

### Then you will see the following page. You can move your iPhone up and down, left and right to control the spaceship to the end point

### After moving the spaceship to the endpoint (the blue block in the left bottom corner), you can choose to play again or not:
